# Simulation-of-sensors--user-interface-and-data-center
Simulation of sensors generating data, user interface and data center.
That is a large scaled project. It consist of 3 applications. 
1st application produces some random data which is supposed to be simulation of sensors. This was a failure in terms of producing realistic data. 
2nd application is user web interface for clients. It is an .Net Core application with MVC design pattern. 
3rd one is the data center where data is recieved from producer application through network sockets.
